WHAT TO DO?

Need to decide between the ideas below:

Idea 1: 
An article feed website/app (a magazine in an app): it’s like Pinterest, but not for images, only for articles. 

Idea 2: 
Rebranding project - 
Silk cakes - Nice Asian-inspired cakes bakery in Forest Hills Queens. 
Their current website: https://www.silkcakes.com/menus/

Idea 3:
Rebranding High Line
My favorite spot in New York.
Their current website: http://www.thehighline.org/

Idea 4:
A portfolio website


HOW IT LOOKS? (EFFECTS WANT TO USE)
